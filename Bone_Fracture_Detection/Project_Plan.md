# ü¶¥ Bone Fracture Detection ‚Äì Project Plan

This document describes the adapted roadmap for the bone fracture detection module, aligning with the existing codebase (transfer learning + dataset balancing + training pipeline). Contributors can follow the phases and tasks below to incrementally improve the module.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning solution for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images using transfer learning. The current implementation achieves 96.05% accuracy with VGG16 architecture and balanced dataset handling. We're looking for Hacktoberfest contributors to help us enhance this project with new features, better documentation, and improved functionality.

## üìã Objectives (Revisited)

- Use transfer learning (VGG16) as the core backbone to build a fracture detection model
- Balance classes and create robust dataset splits (train / val / test)
- Fine-tune, unfreeze layers, and improve performance
- Add downstream components: inference, explainability, deployment, documentation
- Ensure reproducibility and modularity so others can extend / swap parts easily

---

## üîç Existing Baseline Architecture Summary

From the current code:

1. The dataset is balanced by copying / downsampling majority class
2. Split is `train: 0.7`, `val: 0.15`, `test: 0.15`
3. Use `ImageDataGenerator` for augmentation on the training set
4. Use **VGG16** (pretrained) as a frozen base, add `Flatten`, `Dense(512)`, `Dropout`, and final `Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')`
5. Train with `binary_crossentropy`, `Adam`, callbacks: `EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`
6. Fine-tune: unfreeze some layers of VGG16 and continue training at lower LR
7. Evaluate on test set + compute confusion matrix, classification report

So the plan should build on this, adding improved modeling, modularization, inference, visualizations, etc.

## üõ† Phases & Tasks

Here's a refined, actionable roadmap matching the existing code:

## üîê Notes, Constraints, and Considerations

- The dataset path used in the existing code is absolute (`/kaggle/input/...`) ‚Äî modify the code to accept relative or configurable paths.
- For cloud or shared setups, avoid hardcoded paths; use CLI arguments or config files.
- Model weights may get big ‚Äî you may choose to store only best weights or allow users to download them separately.
- Data augmentation should consider maintaining realistic distortions (no unnatural flips in some medical contexts).
- For explainability, ensure heatmaps map correctly to original image resolution.
- Be mindful of class imbalance ‚Äî continue balancing strategies or weight loss functions if needed.
- Add disclaimers: this is a research/demo tool. It is **not** a substitute for clinical diagnosis.
